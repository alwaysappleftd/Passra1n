# Passra1n Source Code by Always Apple FTD

This is the source code (Xcode project) to Passra1n, an untethered iCloud bypass tool for iOS 12.0 to 14.8.1.
You can learn how the tool works by reviewing the code! Please kindly give me credit if you end up using any of my code.


# How to Use Passra1n

### IMPORTANT! The server used in this tool is entirely owned by Apple Tech 752! Huge thanks to him for providing the server; this method wouldn’t be possible without it!

Open the app you downloaded from here.

If you see the "Untrusted Developer" message, follow the steps above to resolve it.
For any other launching issues, please contact me.
Click the "Setup Passra1n" button to ensure everything is installed and ready for using Passra1n.

Click the "Jailbreak Device" button.

If you’re already jailbroken, click "Already Done Jailbreak."
If not, click "Open Checkra1n (Built into this app)" button.
The Checkra1n application is built into Passra1n, so you don't need it in your /Applications folder.
Follow the jailbreak steps in the Checkra1n app. You’ll need to enter DFU Mode on your device, which varies by model.
I recommend searching "How to Enter DFU Mode on [your device model]." For example, "How to Enter DFU Mode on iPhone 6s."
Make sure Checkra1n says "All Done" after the device boots up.
Click the "Bypass Device!" button.

The tool will mount the device's filesystem, inject the certificate, and activate the device tethered.

The tool will prompt you to complete a few simple instructions:

Set up your device.
Open the Checkra1n loader (usually on the second screen) and install Cydia.
Open Cydia and ignore all upgrades.
Click the Search icon tab on the bottom right, tap the Search bar, and look for the package 'Cydia Substrate.'
The quotes are just to show you what to type; they’re not necessary when typing it in.
Tap Modify, then Install, and finally, Confirm.
The package will install. Then click the 'Restart SpringBoard' button when it’s done.
The tool provides full instructions, so don’t rely solely on this webpage.

Once these steps are done, click the green "Cydia Substrate is Installed with No Errors" button in Passra1n.

The tool will make some changes to your device and activate it untethered.

Lastly, there will be some final steps. They might seem complicated, but it’s actually straightforward.

Before attempting these steps, ensure your iCloud-unlocked device is set up!
Sometimes, the required button doesn’t appear when the device is on the Setup.app.
Eject the current SIM card in your iCloud-bypassed device (or get another one from any iPhone).
Insert this SIM card into an iCloud-unlocked device (it can be FMI on, just not bypassed).
Open Settings on the Apple device you just put the SIM card into, then go to Carrier -> SIM PIN.
Slide the switch to green ON, and enter the PIN for your carrier (most SIM cards use 1111).
Save the PIN, eject the SIM card, and put it back in. If the prompt for the PIN appears, you’re good to go.
Ensure your iCloud-unlocked device is set up!
The Cancel button sometimes doesn’t appear when the device is on the Setup.app.
Eject the SIM from the device you added the PIN on, then insert that SIM into your iCloud-locked device.
If the prompt appears but the Cancel button doesn’t, make sure the device is on the Home screen!
When the pop-up appears to enter the PIN, just click Cancel!
IMPORTANT! Never enter the code!
- If you do, you’ll have to restore the device and bypass all over again.
- This is because:
1. It corrupts the device and skips back to the Setup.app, making it almost impossible to re-bypass.
2. The device will likely remember the PIN and always automatically unlock.

Finishing up in Passra1n, click the green "Locked SIM card is in bypassed iDevice" button in Passra1n.
Once everything is done, your device is bypassed untethered!
NOTE: You should probably shut down the device to ensure the bypass is untethered.

If the device behaves differently, such as not activating tethered on the first step, not staying bypassed after a reboot, or if you can’t install Cydia Substrate, there was an error while bypassing the device.
Please contact me with your issue, and I’ll try to help you troubleshoot.
Enjoy your bypassed device! If you have any questions or suggestions, please send me a DM on Instagram or X.
Hope you enjoy using my software!
